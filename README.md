# PoESkillTree.Engine

This repository contains the GameModel and computation engine used for [PoESkillTree](https://github.com/PoESkillTree/PoESkillTree).

The goal is to develop this into a general .NET Standard library for Path of Exile build calculations (e.g. DPS) every interested developer can use and contribute to.,
